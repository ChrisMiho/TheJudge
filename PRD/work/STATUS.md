# Work package status board

Skill-maintained. Glance with `ls PRD/work/*/STATUS.*` or this file.
Vocabulary and transition rules: `PRD/instructions/workflow-reference.md`.
Do not rename package folders to encode status.

| Package | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [quick-lookup-spec](./quick-lookup-spec/) | Phase A #5 of the docs-refactor gameplan — current-state Quick Lookup spec (full backend path). Quality-check PASS; mapped out into 3 verify-only slices (A: UI-facing content, B: backend-path section against source, C: nav row + diff-scope proof). Resume with `/thejudge-implement PRD/work/quick-lookup-spec/ slice A`. |

Moved out of the lifecycle on 2026-08-22 to clear the board. Artifacts are
preserved verbatim under `PRD/ideasForLater/<slug>/`, including each package's
`STATUS.*` marker file recording the stage it was at when parked. To resume
one, move the folder back to `PRD/work/<slug>/` and re-list it under the
matching heading above — the `thejudge-*` skills only look inside `PRD/work/`.
