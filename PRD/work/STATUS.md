# Work package status board

Skill-maintained. Glance with `ls PRD/work/*/STATUS.*` or this file.
Vocabulary and transition rules: `PRD/instructions/workflow-reference.md`.
Do not rename package folders to encode status.

| Package | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [ai-answer-quality-baseline](./ai-answer-quality-baseline/) | Build gate resolved 2026-09-07 by `/loop graph-implement` (run `graph-20260907-032104`): all five slices `done`, 41/41 criteria `true` (E9 the owner-cleared live run, E10 the owner's read-through of run 3), instrument corrected and re-run (semantic retrieval, tier-2 cards attached). PR #203 open into `main`. Re-entered at `build` to confirm, then `review` → `close`; the owner merges after `close` |

Moved out of the lifecycle on 2026-08-22 to clear the board. Artifacts are
preserved verbatim under `PRD/ideasForLater/<slug>/`, including each package's
`STATUS.*` marker file recording the stage it was at when parked. To resume
one, move the folder back to `PRD/work/<slug>/` and re-list it under the
matching heading above — the `thejudge-*` skills only look inside `PRD/work/`.
