# Work package status board

Skill-maintained. Glance with `ls PRD/work/*/STATUS.*` or this file.
Vocabulary and transition rules: `PRD/instructions/workflow-reference.md`.
Do not rename package folders to encode status.

- [rag-rule-retrieval](rag-rule-retrieval/) — upgrade Ask AI's supplemental
  Comprehensive-Rules retrieval (System 3) from lexical keyword/IDF scoring
  toward semantic retrieval, plus the retrieval pre-work (query construction,
  rule-corpus hygiene, Scryfall keyword enrichment) and the RAG-deferred
  mechanic-definition enrichment idea. Consolidates every RAG-shaped work
  folder and the parked, never-merged `semantic-rule-retrieval` design
  (PR #154, closed unmerged) into one pinpoint gameplan. Seeded 2026-09-05.

Moved out of the lifecycle on 2026-08-22 to clear the board. Artifacts are
preserved verbatim under `PRD/ideasForLater/<slug>/`, including each package's
`STATUS.*` marker file recording the stage it was at when parked. To resume
one, move the folder back to `PRD/work/<slug>/` and re-list it under the
matching heading above — the `thejudge-*` skills only look inside `PRD/work/`.
